Annoying reminders to not use your laptop in the couch (Sofa away from me, so far I just can't sit :musical_note:)

I have the bad habit of using my laptop in my couch and I want to do
something about it. I bought a BLE beacon which I plan to leave close
to it, and my idea was to have some program always running in the
background that detects when it's close and reminds me to go to the
desk, in different annoying ways. I saw that there are good BLE
libraries in Rust, so I used this as a excuse to learn the language
and do my first project in it.
